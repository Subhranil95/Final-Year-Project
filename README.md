# Final-Year-Project
In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), energy consumption of the nodes is a very critical issue since senor nodes are battery operated and it is very difficult to replace the batteries when they are deployed in harsh conditions. In this project, a mobile data collector is used for gathering data to prolong the lifetime of the sensor network. The field is divided into equal sized square-shaped grids which are then merged with neighboring grids on the basis of average energy density of the grids to form super grids. The centroids of these merged grids are then used as data collection points. Finally, the data collector gathers the data from these merged grids by finding an optimal path considering both the residual energies of the grids and their distance from each other. The entire process is simulated and the results are analyzed.
